This is where you can give a hat tip to anyone who helped you out on this project. Perhaps you worked in a team or got some inspiration from someone else's solution. This is the perfect place to give them some credit.

###### TODO

HTML:

CSS:

JS:

HOCs + TS - generics + Omit type | fixing 'any' props - rare potential use case

Context - multiple providers | sep folder | HOCs vs children for App context | hook to use + return true if initialised inside its provider (TS destructuring solved)
